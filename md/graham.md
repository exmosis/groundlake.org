About Me
========

Hi, thanks for clicking through to read more. Hopefully this page will give you a bit of a better idea of who I am, without getting too dry or self-indulgent.

My name is Graham Lally. I'm based in the South East of the UK, with easy access to Brighton, Eastbourne, and the flowing paths of the South Downs. I've been working with technology and change since I was a teenager (over 20 years ago), and have always been fascinated by what we can do differently with it.

Like most teenagers in the 90s, I had no idea where technology would go, but I've been lucky enough to see networked computing explode over my professional career. During that time, I've learned a lot:

* A __BSc in Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence__.
* 3 years working in the __dotcom boom__ at the start of the century, on a multitude of __TV and web projects, including major national television series__.
* 2 years working in a start-up with enterprise-level Java frameworks, building __e-commerce and local council sites, and being involved in European research projects__.
* An __MSc in Public Policies for Science, Technology and Innovation__ (with distinction), studying theories of innovation, government policy around technology, and finishing with a dissertation on interactivity and engagement within the public sphere.
* 13 years with a data research consultancy, initially helping to support the company technically, moving to develop interactive data products used by hundreds of public and charity sector clients, and eventually becoming Interim CEO and Head of Technology.

In that time, I've really enjoyed being able to work in so many different roles, and with so many various people and languages. 

* Developer and Senior developer, including key architect and test designer
* Product Owner for a social value metric product, as well as for internal technology
* Researcher and data analyst
* Interim CEO, becoming Head of Technology and Director

I'm now freelance and looking for new challenges. I enjoy energy and efficiency in general, and believe in acting consciously and with conscience for a world that treats everyone and everything fairly.

I also enjoy photography, tai chi, reading and writing, and many other things. I run a [monthly newsletter called "Beamspun"](https://beamspun.exmosis.net/) which covers energy and sustainability, but also ritual, magick and storytelling. Lots of my other things can be found at [exmosis.net](https://www.exmosis.net/).

If you've read this far, why not [drop me an email](mailto:graham@groundlake.org) just to say hi?
