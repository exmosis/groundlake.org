title: Groundlake - Sustainable Technology
---

_Technology isn't magic._ It just gets more abstract, and more hidden away. But underneath all the sheen, it still has a real effect on the world. Materials and energy come from somewhere, and we can do better at using and sourcing technology more responsibly.

Hi, my name is Graham Lally, and I'm passionate about using my experience in technology to help make things better for future generations.

I can help you to:

* Understand the __environmental impact__ of your work
* Identify how you can __improve efficiency__ across what you do
* Make __short- and long-term plans__ to become more energy aware
* Explore how the way you work affects __future generations__

You can [find out more about me here](/graham.html).

My inbox is open. [Click here to email me](mailto:graham@groundlake.org). You can also [find me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/6loss) and [on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/graham-lally-21385987?originalSubdomain=uk).

## WordPress reviews

**I'm currently offering a few energy appraisal reviews each month for anyone running their site on WordPress, on a pay-what-you-feel basis.** Each review includes a look at efficiency and sustainability from server hosting right through to browser clients and business needs. You can see an example report [as a webpage here](/assessments/example/groundlake_example_report_1_0.html), or in [PDF format here](/assessments/example/Groundlake_Example_Report_1_0.pdf).

## Energy and efficiency consulting

__I'm looking to help charities, businesses and other organisations consider the wider effects of the technology being used__. I aim to take a broad perspective that considers not just where energy being used comes from, but how automated and manual processes can be improved, as well as whether activities are truly needed or not.

Each technical system will be unique in some way, but I try to adopt a systemic approach which is capable of covering certain fundamentals, including:

* Looking at direct energy supplies though to indirect energy used (such as working patterns)
* Use of latest tools and frameworks to estimate energy usage and related Greenhouse Gas emissions
* Understandable reporting and suggestions for changes

## Research

As the future is still experimental, I'm also looking to work on __projects that question and reassemble humanity's relationship with energy and technology.__

Sometimes we just don't know what will work and what won't, or even what we want. I believe that when dealing with uncertainty, formal planning and delivery can often be too restrictive. 

If you're interested in collaborating on more art-based projects to explore these themes and narratives, then please do get in touch.
