title: Groundlake - Sustainable Technology
---

_Technology isn't magic._ It just gets more abstract, and more hidden away. But underneath all the sheen, it still has a real effect on the world. Materials and energy come from somewhere, and we can do better at using and sourcing technology more responsibly.

Hi, my name is Graham Lally, and I'm passionate about using my experience in technology to help make things better for future generations. You can [find out more about me here](/graham.html).

## WordPress reviews

**I'm currently offering a few energy appraisal reviews each month for anyone running their site on WordPress, on a pay-what-you-feel basis.** Each review includes a look at efficiency and sustainability from server hosting right through to browser clients and business needs. You can see an example report [as a webpage here](/assessments/example/groundlake_example_report_1_0.html), or in [PDF format here](/assessments/example/Groundlake_Example_Report_1_0.pdf).

## Energy and efficiency consulting

__I'm looking to help charities, businesses and other organisations consider the wider effects of the technology being used__. I aim to take a broad perspective that considers not just where energy being used comes from, but how automated and manual processes can be improved, as well as whether activities are truly needed or not.

Each technical system will be unique in some way, but I try to adopt a systemic approach which is capable of covering certain fundamentals, including:

* Looking at direct energy supplies though to indirect energy used (such as working patterns)
* Use of latest tools and frameworks to estimate energy usage and related Greenhouse Gas emissions
* Understandable reporting and suggestions for changes
